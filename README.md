# flutter_application_1

Hello viewers!!

We developed a Login Application as our final output in our subject CC-206 Application Development under Instructor Mark Joseph Solidarius. To run this application, you must have a connected mobile device to your personal computer or an android emulator. If your android emulator is not working, you can download genymotion as your emulator then run the main.dart file using any flutter compatible compiler.

-You can login using this:
 email: cictapps@wvsu.edu.ph 
 pass:toor

Have fun! Someone is waiting for you on the home screen!!

NOTE:
If any other email or password is used, the login button will not transition you to the home screen.
